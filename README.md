# ‚ù§Ô∏è Cardiac Risk Predictor Dashboard

## Overview

This project involves the development of an **interactive dashboard** designed to analyze and predict cardiac risk factors based on various demographic and health indicators. Built primarily using **Microsoft Excel's data analysis capabilities**, this dashboard provides a clear visualization of critical trends and distributions related to heart conditions.

## Features

* **Key Health Metrics:** Displays average age and average blood sugar levels, providing a quick overview of patient health data.
* **Age and Gender-Based Analysis:** Visualizes the distribution of heart conditions across different age groups (e.g., Young Adults, Middle Age, Elderly) and by gender (Male/Female).
* **Heart Rate & Blood Sugar Trends:** Shows trends in average heart rate and blood sugar levels across different age categories.
* **Gender-Specific Insights:** Compares average heart rate between genders and analyzes heart condition frequency by status (Normal/Critical) and gender.
* **Interactive Filtering:** Allows users to filter data by gender and specific age groups for focused analysis.

## Tools Used

* **Microsoft Excel:** Core tool for data analysis and dashboard visualization.
* **Power Query:** Utilized for cleaning, transforming, and loading raw patient data.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Applied within Power Pivot for creating calculated measures and columns to derive analytical insights.
* **Pivot Tables & Charts:** Used for summarizing data and generating dynamic and interactive charts (e.g., Line Charts, Bar Charts, Doughnut Charts).
* **Slicers:** Implemented for intuitive filtering and exploring specific demographic segments.

## Key Insights & Findings

* **Age Group Susceptibility:** Analysis indicates that individuals aged 31-49 show the highest susceptibility to elevated heart rates, while those aged 50-70 show lower susceptibility.
* **Gender Disparities:** Males between 50-70 years old are more prone to cardiac issues compared to females in the same age group.
* **Average Heart Rate:** The average heart rate for males is found to be lower than that for females.
* **Critical Cases Breakdown:** Out of 379 critical cardiac cases, 256 are males and 123 are females.
* **Normal Cases Breakdown:** Out of 940 normal cardiac cases, 614 are males and 326 are females.
* **Female Susceptibility by Age:** Females aged 31-49 are most susceptible to heart problems, whereas those aged 14-29 show the lowest susceptibility.

## How to Use

1.  Download the `Cardiac_Risk_Predictor.xlsx` file from this repository.
2.  Open the file in Microsoft Excel (version 2016 or later is recommended for full interactivity).
3.  Navigate to the 'Dashboard' sheet.
4.  Utilize the interactive filters (Gender, Age Group) on the left side to explore specific segments of the data.

## Future Improvements

* Integrating additional risk factors and clinical data for a more comprehensive predictive model.
* Implementing advanced statistical analysis techniques to identify complex correlations.
* Exploring the use of Power BI for enhanced visualization and data sharing capabilities.
